# ChessAi



Built a chess AI app by nuilding my own neural network. Use of minmax function to better execute decisions in the decision tree. Around 1200-1300 elo, beats me quite easily. Use of around 5 million moard positions for training.
**Better improvements**
-Train the network on more data sets, wasn't able to do so due to lack of capacity.
